- Pain level (0-10 scale)

Date handling:
- If patient mentions "today", "this morning", "tonight" - use current_date
- If patient mentions "yesterday" - use current_date minus 1 day
- If patient mentions specific dates like "December 25" or "last Monday" - calculate the actual date
- If no date mentioned, assume current_date

Be conversational and helpful. If information is unclear or incomplete, ask for clarification."""

            user_prompt = f"""Current date: {current_date}

Patient says: "{conversation_text}"

Guidelines:
- Extract only values explicitly mentioned
- Set null for values not mentioned
- If multiple measurements with different dates, create separate entries in vitals array
- If unclear or ambiguous, set needs_clarification to true and provide a clarification_question
- Always provide a friendly_confirmation message summarizing what was recorded"""
